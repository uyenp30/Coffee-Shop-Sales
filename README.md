## 🙏 Acknowledgment

This project was inspired by [WsCube Tech’s YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rthh_bK5xUs), which introduced valuable techniques for building Excel dashboards using coffee shop sales data.

While I took my own approach and made custom adjustments, the video helped spark ideas for layout, interactivity, and business-focused insights.

Big thanks as well to [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/) for sharing the dataset and supporting learners like me 🌱
